Stuff I did for code signal

Each one of these files contains a single function that solves a problem found on code signal. 
To find out more about the problems that these functions solve one could either join codesignal and work through the problems.
Or they might be able to find the problem using a google search.

I do not include the problem description. I only solve the problem in a relatively succinct way.
